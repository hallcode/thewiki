What is a Resolver?

The problem:    You have a single URL pattern which can point to
                different resources / models / controllers etc depending
                on user input.

The solution:   a)  Create separate routes for all the resources. This is okay
                    but it can leave your router file looking monstrous and
                    overgrown.

                b)  Create a another class with static methods, which can be used
                    to determine what to do with the request using
                    advanced logic.

                    This leaves the controllers and route files lighter and more
                    concerned with their main tasks. It also means you don't
                    have to repeat the same logic in different controller methods.

So basically, Resolvers work something out, which shouldn't be done over and over in controllers, or clutter
up models, and is too detailed for routing.
